# Learn-Python-with-me
This repository contains my Python practice files and projects as I am learning programming. I am using Jupyter Notebook to write and run my code, with a focus on building a strong foundation in Python. I am learning this from "Study Mart," which offers a special free course on Python called "60 Days of Python".
